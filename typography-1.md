| TYPOGRAPHY
============

Axis Design uses the font **Roboto** to create charts. If Roboto cannot
be used on a clientâ€™s computer, a suitable replacement is Arial. In case
of Qlik Sense dashboards Qlik Sense Sans is a suitable replacement.

Good chart typography creates a hierarchy among elements and guides the
reader through the visual. Good chart typography also allows us to
present data dense visuals in a consumable fashion.

Typography plays a huge role in how people perceive and compare numbers.
